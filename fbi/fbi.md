# Fbi Usage Guide


## Facebook App Token

First, we would require an App Token to access Facebook's API

I would love to have included my App Token in this program, so I did a stress test and it turns out, FB throttles API usage. To avoid downtime when too many users hit the API with the same App Token, we wanna use our own
